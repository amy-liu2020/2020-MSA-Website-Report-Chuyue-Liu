## Website Report 

### Website link 

 [Link to my website](http://amyliufeast.azurewebsites.net/)



### Issues: 
This website is a resume website base on WordPress. The idea is to impress the employer and other people. Therefore the website design needs to be stylish and easy to read. It also needs to include a lot of photos and some videos.

- As videos need to include in this website, to avoid uploading large size of videos, it is required to embed videos from YouTube. 

- To improve the layout of the website and make the contents easy to read, a powerful front end plugin is recommended. 

- On the other hand, as many photos need to be included It is better to compress photos to increase the speed. To stylish the photos, the gallery will be helpful. 

- Need to increase the speed of the website as fast as possible. 

- In the real world, we want the website to appear as the top searches from searching engines. Therefore we need to improve the SEO of the website. 

- We want to track the viewers and users of the website, so we can analyze the data to see whether we achieve enough amount of viewings. 
 

### Plugins and benefits: 

To enhance the performance of this website, I used several plugins: 

- SEO plugin 

     - “Rank Math SEO” is chosen. It is a revolutionary SEO product. I chose this plugin over anything else because this plugin combines features of many SEO tools. It has a different level of implementation, therefore it is suitable for all levels of users. 

     - The dashboard of this plugin is simple and straight forward. It provides detailed instruction that enables users to modify the website to enhance SEO. 

- Cache management plugin 

     - “LiteSpeed Cache” for WordPress is chosen. 

     - It is used to increased the speed of the website. This plugin designed specific to WordPress, supports WordPress and is compatible with many plugins, therefore it can be useful for the future development of the website. 

- Analytics plugin 

     - “MonsterInsights” is chosen. It is a plugin based on Google Analytics.  

     - It is chosen because it can easily gain access to google analytics. Its dashboard is clear and well designed. It can also output reports in Docx. 

     - This plugin enables to track on numbers of viewers and returner. Helps to track and analysis the reasons that people come back to the website, therefore support further improvement of the website. 

- Photo Gallery plugin 

     - “Photo Gallery” is used. It is a plugin that enables to create galleries. 

     - It enables a better view of the photo gallery. It is chosen because while it is free, it provides useful photo galleries with different designs type (slideshows,  thumbnails...). 

     - This plugin is useful for adding my pictures for certificates and skills.

     - “Embed Plus for Youtube” is used. It allows embedment of video, YouTube channel, playlist and live stream. 

     - It is chosen because it is straight forwards, easy to set up, and contains enough features that I need. 

- Front-end page builder plugin 

     - “Elementor” is chosen. It has different and useful features with a different theme, a high level of freedom that allows me to design a better website. Its pro version has more features and allows CSS implementation which can strongly support the future improvement of the website design. 

- Anti-Spam plugin 

     - “Anti-Spam by CleanTalk” is used. It can protect the website from spam and it is free. Among all free anti-spam plugin, I believe it is the best choice. It protects the website by building a firewall. 
     - It also provides protections for all forms, therefore provides any information the website collects. Meanwhile, this function is not so useful as no form is added to the website, but it may be useful in the future, as I may want to include a contact form. 

- Image Optimizer plugin 

     - “Smush” is used. It reduces image file sizes while maintaining a similar quality. It can optimize the page speed and it can also support the SEO products.
